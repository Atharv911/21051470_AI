# Image generation
1. Initialization:
   - Initialization serves as the fundamental step in any genetic algorithm. In this code, it is facilitated through the setup of a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Swing framework. A JFrame is created, providing a window for the GA to operate within.
   - Subsequently, a JFileChooser dialog is presented to the user, enabling them to select a target image for optimization. This target image represents the ideal outcome to which the GA aims to converge.
   - An essential aspect of the initialization is the creation of an initial population of images, referred to as chromosomes. These images are initialized with a fixed population size of 50. The population is established by copying the target image 50 times. Each image within the population embodies a potential solution to the optimization problem.

2. Evaluation:
   - The evaluation phase is crucial for quantifying the quality of solutions within the population. In the context of image optimization, the fitness of each image, or how closely it resembles the target image, is computed. This is achieved through the `calculateFitness` method, which measures the pixel-wise difference between an image and the target image.
   - The code tracks the image with the lowest fitness throughout the algorithm's execution, representing the best image found so far. It's important to emphasize that a lower fitness value signifies a closer resemblance to the target image, making it the most desirable outcome.

3. Selection:
   - Selection constitutes the process of choosing individuals (images) from the current population to serve as parents for producing the next generation. While the code acknowledges the importance of this step, it leaves the actual implementation of the selection method as a placeholder. Various selection methods are available, such as Roulette Wheel Selection, Tournament Selection, and Rank-Based Selection.
   - The selection method, when implemented, will evaluate the fitness of individuals within the population and choose parents based on their fitness values. The primary goal is to favor individuals with superior fitness to increase the likelihood of passing on desirable traits to the next generation.

4. Crossover:
   - Crossover, also known as recombination, is a genetic operator aimed at combining the genetic material of two parent individuals to generate one or more offspring. The `crossover` method is designated to perform this operation; however, the specific crossover technique (e.g., one-point or two-point crossover) is left unimplemented.
   - The choice of the actual crossover strategy is contingent on the specific problem domain and the genetic representation of individuals. In the realm of image optimization, it's conceivable that a crossover approach might involve selecting distinct regions or features from each parental image and amalgamating them to create a novel image.

5. Mutation:
   - Mutation is another genetic operator responsible for introducing random alterations into an individual's genetic material. In the code, the `mutate` method is tasked with applying mutations to the new generation of images. Similar to crossover, the specific mutation method remains unimplemented.
   - Mutation operations in image optimization might encompass random pixel alterations, geometric transformations, or other techniques aimed at injecting variability into the population. The overarching purpose is to explore new possibilities and deter premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.

6. Replacement:
   - After the completion of crossover and mutation, the old population is supplanted with the new generation of images. This cyclical process is reiterated for a predetermined number of generations, in this case, 100. Each generation brings incremental improvement as the algorithm evolves the population toward the target image.
   - Throughout these iterations, the GA endeavors to converge towards an optimal or near-optimal solution, continually enhancing the quality of the images in the population.

7. Display:
   - The final outcome of the GA, the best image found, is showcased through a GUI window using the Swing framework. This image is the closest approximation to the target image achieved by the GA. Its display allows users to visually assess the quality of the optimization results.
